# Burp Suite - Intro to Penetration Testing

![BurpSuite](https://github.com/ssamarasam/cyber-security-learning/blob/6106dcd53511776dc312cc2142b6a7229efc1b2c/Tools/Images/Screenshot%20from%202024-07-18%2015-19-11.png)

- is a tool/collection of tools designed to perfom security testing on web applications
- identify and exploit vulnerabilities
- commity edition
- dashboard tab
- target tab - define your application here - dev or uat environments or other
  - including scope of the application
  - address you wnat to include or exclude
- proxy
  - used for interception
  - incercept between your browser and target application
- intruder
  - a tool that automates complex attacks such as brute force against your target
- repeater
  - a tool that allows you to manually send and recive http or https request and inspects the responses
- sequencer - tools to test the randomness of tokens generated by an appliation
- decoders - allows to encode or decode using various protocols
- comparer - helps to cpom[pare two different info at byte level
- logger - is to generate the logs
- extension - can isnatll multiple extensions - internal or external which are avilable

### Discover vulnerable test applications
> docker ps -a
> which gives all the running and stopped container in this machine
> docker start "container-id" - this will start the container which is in stopped/exit status
> docker ps   -> to check the status

- open browser and enter localhost to launch DVWA - dawn vulnerable web application

### Configure Burp Proxy and intercept HTTP traffic
- intercepting http request between client and serevr
- to check whether server also have proper validation
- so burp sit proxy will b ein between client and server requet and it will intercept the request and response
- we can modify the request which is sent from client before it is reaching the server and then you forward the request to the server
- click the proxy tab
  - it has intercept, http history, websockets history and proxy settings
  - proxy settings - define all the proxy listeners - so you can use either the default browser provided by burp-suite for intercepting the request or you can set any broswer on your system to use
  - request interception rukes - you can exlcude things like images, gif, css to skip the intercepting
  - response interception rules
  -

Set Intercept to ON

Open inbuilt browser from burp suite
enter portswigger.com
see the intercepted message
you can forward, drop it or can do various operations from Action list


if you set intercept is off, then go and refresh the brower with the url, the requets will flow thru normal

### Modify the HTTP request after intercepting in Burp Suite and before forwarding it to server
- file upload vulnerability - an app allows application to upload files without proper validation
- clould lead to execution of malicious activities



### Reissue the individual modified HTTP request multiple times with the burp repeater
- will be able to resend a request with different input data multiple times to explore vulnerabilities
- guessing multiple times - like brute force
- modify the request and run multiple times
- intruder also can be used to automate this process

- intercept OFF
- open local host
- login page will be opned
- intercept ON
- try using wrong pwd intentionally
- interceptor will capture the request
- right click and "send to repeater"
- go to repeater tab
- in the request section
  - modify the pwd and SEND
  - check the response
  - you can repeat until pwd is matched in the repeater tab
 
- follow redirection
- you can also go to the previous page by using the arrows before the "follow redirection " button
- you can create multiple TABs for various request


Capstone project:
- develop a list of common vulnerabilities in web application such as SQL injection, HTML injection and others
- write the scripts to intercept and modify requests, test for common vulnerabilities and generate a report on the findings
- sample BWAPP application - http://localhost/81
