# Burp Suite - Intro to Penetration Testing

![BurpSuite](https://github.com/ssamarasam/cyber-security-learning/blob/6106dcd53511776dc312cc2142b6a7229efc1b2c/Tools/Images/Screenshot%20from%202024-07-18%2015-19-11.png)

- is a tool/collection of tools designed to perfom security testing on web applications
- identify and exploit vulnerabilities
- commity edition
- dashboard tab
- target tab - define your application here - dev or uat environments or other
  - including scope of the application
  - address you wnat to include or exclude
- proxy
  - used for interception
  - incercept between your browser and target application
- intruder
  - a tool that automates complex attacks such as brute force against your target
- repeater
  - a tool that allows you to manually send and recive http or https request and inspects the responses
- sequencer - tools to test the randomness of tokens generated by an appliation
- decoders - allows to encode or decode using various protocols
- comparer - helps to cpom[pare two different info at byte level
- logger - is to generate the logs
- extension - can isnatll multiple extensions - internal or external which are avilable

### Discover vulnerable test applications
> docker ps -a
> which gives all the running and stopped container in this machine
> docker start "container-id" - this will start the container which is in stopped/exit status
> docker ps   -> to check the status

- open browser and enter localhost to launch DVWA - dawn vulnerable web application

### Configure Burp Proxy and intercept HTTP traffic
- intercepting http request between client and serevr
- to check whether server also have proper validation
- so burp sit proxy will b ein between client and server requet and it will intercept the request and response
- we can modify the request which is sent from client before it is reaching the server and then you forward the request to the server
- click the proxy tab
  - it has intercept, http history, websockets history and proxy settings
  - proxy settings - define all the proxy listeners - so you can use either the default browser provided by burp-suite for intercepting the request or you can set any broswer on your system to use
  - request interception rukes - you can exlcude things like images, gif, css to skip the intercepting
  - response interception rules
