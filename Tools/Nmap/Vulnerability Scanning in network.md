# Vulnerability Scanning using Nmap: Network Scanning

Completion certificate link: https://coursera.org/share/09778a9d78d3e6f6a0e111714de34aa9

> nmap == Network mapper
> can identity active hosts on network
> can map all the connected devices in a network and their respective ip addresses
> 

### Verify the Nmap installation and its version
> nmap --version
- compatibility checks
- troubleshooting


### Access the help feature and man page for nmap
> nmap --help
> nmap   -> brings the same output as above
> man namp  (detailed info)
  - host discovery
  - scan techniques
  - q to quit man page


### Perform a basic nmap scan
- to discover active hosts
- open ports
- running services

> nmap scanme.nmap.org
> nmap scanme.namp.org/30   - sider notation in ip address and subnets
> nmap ipaddress
>

### namp using options
> nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org
> A --> aggressive flag to capture as much as information - enable os detection, version detetcion, script scanning and traceroute
- os detection
- version detection
- may generate more system traffic and may consume more system resources - may affect the tagetitng network
- used for vulnerability scanning
> T - timing and performance
 - the higher the number, the fatsre the scan
 - because of the speed, accuracy might be sacrificed

tcpwrapped - remote administration tool - added layer of security - fileters incoming connections


### Output nmap scan results to a file
- check PORT SPECIFICATION section - port
- check MISC section - A

> state: filtered -> some firewalls or tools blocking 

> nmap -p 80 -A -oN scan.txt scanme.nmap.org
>

### Cumulative activity
In this challenge task, you have been asked to run a customized scan on a target and save the scan results in a txt file for the Security Team to review in the next meeting. You will:

1) Perform a nmap scan, scanning ports 22-80, on target: scanme.nmap.org
2) Use the appropriate option to enable OS and version detection, script scanning, and traceroute
3) Set your scan to -T3 for the timing execution of the scan
4) Output the scan results to a txt file named: output.txt
5) Verify the contents of the output.txt file
6) Be sure to reference your nmap man page for help

> nmap -p 22-80 -A -T3 -oN scannew.txt scanme.nmap.org
