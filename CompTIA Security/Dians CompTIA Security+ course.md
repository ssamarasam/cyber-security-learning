# General Security Concepts

Threat - anyting that could harm, loss, damage or compromise to IT systems
Risks
Vulnerability

Confidentiality
- encr
- access controls
- data masking - obscurng data inaccessibile (like hiding 12 digits oif card number)
- physical sec measures
- training awareness

> confidentiality -> encryption

Integrity:
- data accuracy
- trust
- system operability
1. hashing - hash digest /   digital footprint
2. digit sig - using users private key, ency and hash it
3. checksums - during transmit 
4. access controls
5. regular audits

> integrity -> hashing

Availability
- ensu business conti
- maintain cus trust
- upholding an org's reputation

**redundancy**
- server redudancy
- data redu
- netw redun - if one netw path fails, can travel thru other route
- power redun

> Availability -> redundancy

Non-repudiation - undeniable proof of their action
- digital signature - hashing the msg with digitally signed and encr the hash digest with the users private key using asymmetric encryption
